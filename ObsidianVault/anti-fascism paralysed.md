in elections right b4 hitler assumes power the % of the electorate that didn't support NSDAP or RW parties was still majority
--> "there was no prospect that this statistical majority could be converted into a unified political force" *(p268)* //reminds me of [[stephenson-jill-1997]]'s concluding point that G society was too fragmented

- too much division among them, (examples given 268, KPD-SPD squabbles, centre, trade unions uselessness) where their joint efforts may have made a difference
- [[Marxist thought couldn't account for the dynamism of NSDAP]] *(p268-269)*
