Diderot + Condillac take up sensationalism from Locke 
(https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/condillac/)
			Whereas John Locke’s empiricism followed upon a rejection of innate principles and innate ideas, Condillac went further and rejected innate abilities as well. On his version of empiricism, experience not only provides us with “ideas” or the raw materials for knowledge, it also teaches us how to focus attention, remember, imagine, abstract, judge, and reason.
			The pursuit of this tenet led Condillac to articulate an early developmental psychology, with explicit pedagogical and methodological implications.
			His concerns also led him to focus on the theory of perception, and to advance important and original views on our perception of spatial form.
			Presented a highly nuanced account of how this raw data is worked up into our beliefs about the world around us.
