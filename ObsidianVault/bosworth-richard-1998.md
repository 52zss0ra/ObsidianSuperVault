## 1 - 'Second Republic' + a Usable Past
concerned with the 90s. parties are now quite unrecognisable; having symbolic names. how they ignore which role they played when Fascism played out circa Salo Republic + Kingdom.

conservative De Felice thinks historians shouldn't prescribe moral lines etc just study the past on its own terms. the history of Fascism must be read apolitically
	//when studying you get that flame where you hate it from a marxist perspective, you must disagree, when there's a link, approach with your framework anyways. like weberian, marxist etc
one of followers described historian's role as 'conscious acquisition' of facts 
	// [[history vs the past... the difference is questions... discussion]] 
fascism as being birthed out of complete originality, fascination and ideas being brought to power for the 1st time, pinned down by a genuine intellectual base. 'culturalist' approach, myths + symbols; also, not seeing Fascism/Musso as opportunist but taking their claims @ face value
	// you just know that's ahistorical,,, like leftist policies that didn't stand out 1919 party programme, also the intelligentsia not really engaging meaningfully with the ideology; just for their job
American Jeffrey T Schnapp poses that the reason Fascism was so successful in being est in post ww1 italy was less due to violent tactics, policies OR THE WEAKNESS OF THE LIBERAL ST8 and more to the alluring (more than any other modern ideology) myth and psychologically astute culture
	Bosworth points out that, what did massive displays and thoughts have to do with the average giovanni? like italy was still majorly constituted by peasants + workers. + says that cultural historians fall into the trap of 'credulously reporting what [Fascism] said rather than critically exploring what it means' in their attempt to treat it on its own terms + apolitically

anti-anti fascist orthodoxy of 90s sought to blot out the anti-fascist rhetoric of: never again, that was too violent + horrible. because they kind of want to adopt that control. 

to get a wider understanding of how diff groups experienced fascism, turn away from De Felice's culturalist approach
