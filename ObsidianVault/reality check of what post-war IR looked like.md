the Fascists + Nazis simplified their ideas that they were two PEOPLE whereas the french + british were sneaky elites, politicians, not for the people in their propaganda. As a fact, Lloyd George, Clemenceau, Wilson. BIG personalities at peace treaties

Churchill + Roosevelt had personal meetings too
