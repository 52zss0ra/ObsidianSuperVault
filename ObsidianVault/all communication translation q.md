George Steiner *After Babel* (1975)
	- "human communication equals translation"
	every act of communication is to transl8 as it involves understanding, hearing significance
		// listening to foreign speech you can't understand it because you can't distinguish which sounds have which meaning 
Evidence: literary works from last 500 years, which modern readers have to do interpretation on in order to make sense of them
										making sense of Shakespeare's words involves knowing how to translate them into a newer idiom: we translate ‘which’ into ‘who’, and so on.


But this proves the opposite? (translation ≠ communication)
	Instead, it is part of communication. We reach for translation when we encounter an obstruction to understanding, when we realize that the words that confront us are not entirely within our grasp. 
	Whereas, if familiar, don't need to read in translation.
- if you did, the only way it would make sense to say that understanding these sorts of words is a form of ‘translation’ would be if there were some secret language in the mind that absolutely all words had to be translated into: meaning. 
										a kind of language in itself? so you transl8 into when you understand a word
But, if understanding = process of translating, 
		how would you then understand the ‘meaning’? 
You would have to translate it in its turn etc etc endlessly recursive.


BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BY JUST KNOWING THE WORDS
∴ communication ≠ translation




<u>But to support the claim...</u>
The idea of ‘Translation Rigidly Conceived’ reinforces that there are separate languages: these are usually official languages supported by political st8s 
		// but consider [[meanings unaltered across langs]] which you reson8 with


If ‘translation’ is something that only happens between these languages, then it follows that people who have the same official language don’t need translation because they can all understand each other without it. But in fact people use language in all sorts of different ways, and there is always scope for misunderstanding.


You might be divided by class and political commitment: one person’s ‘scab’ (‘strike-breaker’) is another’s ‘hardworking employee’.
