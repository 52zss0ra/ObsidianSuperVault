Jacques Derrida essay ‘Des tours de Babel’, 
	points out overlap between languages using proper nouns (Babel) as e.g.
	therefore they aren't discrete entities that a complete distinction can be drawn between

Words that are shared between what we think of as different languages, often with minor shifts of spelling and pronunciation serve as an example of this too. // I think of Camus' *L'etranger* and how I approve more of the title tranlsation *The Outsider* porque entiendo la palabra estrangero
		- spelling, pronunciation aren't too much of a barrier then
		- esp since everyone speaks with their own timbre, accent, intonation (accents within england even may sound as foreign as a french one)


SPELLING: rules + standardisation only est. last 300 yrs bc of formal purposes, printing
	People’s actual spelling (when uncorrected by computer) varies widely

	variant spellings may be incorrect according to the currently accepted rulebooks; but     that needn’t stop them being used and understood by English speakers.
		‘paragraphe’, ‘prononciation’, ‘langage’, and ‘essai’ in a piece of English writing
