like emmie youtube video book reviews "doesn't even read like translation", expectation that it should assimilate to english + lose that cultural element

whereas in other countries (like where English is cool) bc of the [[dominance of english linked to imperialism + capitalism]] if it sounds like it came from english it makes it sound more interesting and that's the goal of the translation

- translation VSI: Elizabeth Barrett Browning 'Poems from the Portuguese' pretended that they were translated to draw distance between themselves and her in the public perception bc they were very personal to her 
- translation VSI: Either it is ‘foreignizing’—to use the contemporary terminology of translation studies—or it is ‘domesticating’.
- translation VSI: [[to foreignize or not to foreignize]]  //creates language
