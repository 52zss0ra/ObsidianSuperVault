Scones are more specific to English culture than houses are, so other languages don’t have ready-made words with the same propositional meaning. Often it will seem easier simply to reproduce the English word and explain its meaning in a note or leave it to be deduced from the context.

realia e.g. curry, whisky, hijab, fjord, schadenfreude

So translation does not translate the meanings of words; at least, not in the sense of taking the meaning of a word in one language and finding a word with the same meaning in another.
If I say that dar means ‘house’ I downplay all the actual differences in meaning between the two words. All I am really saying is that dar is a word you might use to translate ‘house’, and vice versa.

propositional meanings that can’t be matched by any single words in other languages.
