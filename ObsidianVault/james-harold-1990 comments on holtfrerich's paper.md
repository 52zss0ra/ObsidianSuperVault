Comment on Carl Holtfrerich's paper


Holt views W econ as more redeemable than James + ignores fiscal constraints pn W govt*(p162)*

"As a result of the more optimistic picture of what Bruning might have done, Holt is less inclined to see the period as a tragedy than as an era of mistaken policy carried out for ideological (conservative) reasons, or from a misplaced sense of the importance of removing Germany's reparations burden" *(p162)*
