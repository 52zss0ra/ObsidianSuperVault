- If you reproduce rhyme you are likely to have to sacrifice other important elements of your source text. And languages have differing propensities for rhyme, so the same poetic form can feel quite different in different tongues.

- (dante example for context) 
-these words too are there for the rhyme, and THEY BRING NEW IMAGES WITH THEM. That’s not all. Keeping the same rhyme scheme doesn’t mean that the verse feels the same. Dante’s rhymes are soft because, like most Italian words, they end on an unaccented syllable (this used to be called ‘feminine’ rhyme; the modern technical term is ‘paroxytonic’). And rhymes are easier to find in Italian than in English. So terza rima feels MORE INTRUSIVE in Sayers’s English than in Dante’s Italian: it is a performance rather than a pulse.

-Since Longfellow doesn’t have to juggle rhymes he can make his words and syntax correspond more closely to Dante’s. On the other hand, the forward impetus of terza rima has been lost. The challenge of poetic form gives us a stark instance of a familiar truth: translation never provides an exact reproduction of any element of the source text. It is always a matter of shifts and alterations: a metamorphosis, not a copy. Not even a rhyme scheme can be recreated without some difference seeping in.

- identity // i decide as the translator which part of the poet's identity I show off or leave in softer focus
-Dante’s identity as a writer is complex: the two translations reveal different sides of it. Longfellow and Dorothy L. Sayers chose different aspects of Dante’s identity as a writer to represent in English. Readers of Sayers’s translation encounter a virtuoso of the terza rima form; readers of Longfellow’s find a devotee of a plain and lapidary style.

		every translation mediates between the source text and the receiving language and culture. The translation cannot completely reproduce the source text in all its distinctiveness and foreignness: that would mean not translating it at all. 
		the translation can’t completely domesticate the source text either: it can’t abolish its distinctiveness and foreignness completely. To do that would be to write a new, different text.
