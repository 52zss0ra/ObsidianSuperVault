there's no point in asserting what you think makes a 'true translation' e.g. only happens between diff standard langs (Japanese + French) as opposed to between different dialects of the same language (arabic derija vs more eastern ones)

	(J C Catford: words that are interchangeable in a given situation, idiomatic esp. all we are doing is providing English words that we hope other people will understand[[mediation and the avoidance of conflict]])

considering many points, then we can determine what can be called translation like from the examples
"All these instances belong in and around the territory of translation. They all use words to stand in for other words. But there are also large differences between them, and they happen in varied terrains. If we are to pinpoint them on our map, we need to explore how translation relates to other kinds of re-wording."
