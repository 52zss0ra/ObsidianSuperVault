	- (historic burden) shadow of lost war, politicians 'stab in the back' myth *(p6)*

	- population in the cities growing: new 'superflouous' generation + migration from countryside to city, saturated job market, unemployment *(p7, p18)* 

	- conflicts about role of women, not having enough babies *(p9)* //new women scare

	- debates surrounding unease @ modernisation + industrialisation vs welcoming progress *(p11)* peukert says 'modernization had reached a state of crisis'

this would result in an attachment to radical politics yk
