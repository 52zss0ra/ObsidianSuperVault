// this reminds me of [[islam's spread through africa where it had to compromise orthodox aspects to be adopted within places with already established belief systems that could include other practices]]

after Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir Munsyi came across Bible translations that had been done by the Dutch preacher and doctor Melchior Leydekker nearly a century before, he found the punctuation and idiom felt wrong to him: ‘it all sounded very clumsy to my ear, and I was inclined to say: “this is a book of the white man” ’.

Nowadays, missionaries tend to be anxious to avoid the sort of awkwardness that troubled Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir Munsyi. The dominant theorist of missionary translation, Eugene Nida, recommends the use of anything that sounds natural in the receiving language, with the cultural and doctrinal specifics of the Bible text being downplayed accordingly. In the Bamabra language of West Africa, the English word ‘redemption’ should be translated with a term that literally means something like ‘God took our heads out’ (i.e. from the iron collar of slavery). In contemporary America, the phrase that appears in the King James Bible as ‘salute one another with a holy kiss’ should become ‘give each other a hearty handshake all round’.

// woah 
: Missionaries can adopt this permissive practice of translation because they feel that their whole enterprise is divinely sanctioned. Their job is not so much to give readers a precise understanding of the holy text as to persuade them to join a community of believers.
// this also reminds me of [[catholic mass in England being in Latin and low understanding and devotion as a result compared to when CofE started up]]


this can be seen to a lesser extent where [[beliefs and doctrine under threat by translations]]
