Economic policy options and the end of the WR
[[my bibliography]]


line of reasoning: [[bruning had room for maneuvre, not handling the economic situation correctly is what led to nazis' rise to power (bye bye Weimar Republic)]]

insane concluding quotes *(p73-74)*: 
- *'I would prefer to call it an avoidable failure in political leadership, defined as a situation in which democratic parties pursue goals of some political power elites, but disrespect the electorate's primary concerns.'*

- *'could Brüning and his political camp not have done better with actual measures in that direction? It seems to me that Brüning's situation is better described by lack of determination than by lack of options or of a political force to pursue expansionary economic policies after July 1931.'*
		(comparing the Nazis increasing their political support tremendously by promising to revive the economy) 

### A critical view of the economic setting of the Borchardt thesis
[[contrary to borchardt and james he views the inter war period as not bad economically]] *(p75-76)*
