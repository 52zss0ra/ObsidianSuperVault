*(p32)*

The Weimar economy provided a focus for hopes + expectations
			ww1 had resulted in tremendous shifts in income + status that some thought should cont, whereas others thought should be reversed (so workers looking for pay rises, farmers for tariff protections, employers for govt subsidies, civil s 4 return 2 their pre-war status)
The WR responded to these in a centralised way, hoping to avoid clashes. but this '**merely transferred wage and labour conflicts from the factory to the level of the st8**'
