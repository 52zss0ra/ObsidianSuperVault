Decisions of this kind tend to be particularly charged when they have to do with gender and sexuality. In Lesotho, in southern Africa, women can develop intense friendships with other women which can co-exist happily with marriage even though they involve sexual intimacy. The Sesotho term for this sort of relationship is motsoalle. How could we translate it? The word ‘lesbian’ would bring with it a set of assumptions that don’t fit this context, while ‘very special friend’, the phrase chosen by one translator, sounds twee. Perhaps the best solution would be to use the Sesotho term with an explanatory footnote, thereby making it possible for a new word, naming a new aspect of gender identity and sexuality, to come into English.
