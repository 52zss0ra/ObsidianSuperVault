It is sometimes said that translators have a responsibility to give a strong impression of the linguistic particularity, or ‘otherness’ of the source text. This view has roots in work by the German philosopher Friedrich Schleiermacher in the 19th century, and was elaborated by the French literary critic Antoine Berman in the 1980s; it has since been popularized in the Anglophone world by the translation theorist Lawrence Venuti. 

But the value of a ‘foreignizing’ style of translation is always dependent on context. To bring the word motsoalle into English is to foreignize—and that seems necessary. But to Leela Sarkar in Kerala or to the dragoman writing to Elizabeth I, it was more important to produce a text that would not offend their readers. Translators’ responsibilities pull in different directions, and they feel the pressure of competing powers.
