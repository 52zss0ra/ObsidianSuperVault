politicial + economic interests linked to language:
- st8s typically promote the standardisation of language. Can help form group identity
	- e.g. schools, dictionaries
	- hence saying ''a language is a dialect with an army and a navy" [[patriotism]]
	- practical government aided by this too: tax-collecting, law-giving easier when everyone communicates, writes in a similar way


All speakers of Corsican also speak French, so when a book is translated from French into Corsican it does not allow more people to read the book, but it does strengthen the idea that Corsican is a separate language. When the 2008 Basque novel Bilbao-New York-Bilbao by Kirmen Uribe is translated simultaneously into Castilian Spanish, Galician, and Catalan a similar point is made.
