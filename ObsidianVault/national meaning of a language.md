Behind the obvious influence of schools, dictionaries, and so on lie political and economic interests. States typically promote the standardization of language. Hence the saying, ‘a language is a dialect with an army and a navy’. Law-giving and tax-collecting are so much easier when everyone speaks and writes in a similar way. Language is also an important part of group identity, so promoting a uniform language, and getting people to feel attached to it, builds patriotism.

All speakers of Corsican also speak French, so when a book is translated from French into Corsican it does not allow more people to read the book, but it does strengthen the idea that Corsican is a separate language. When the 2008 Basque novel Bilbao-New York-Bilbao by Kirmen Uribe is translated simultaneously into Castilian Spanish, Galician, and Catalan a similar point is made. Back in 1844, when William Barnes translated his Poems in the Dorset Dialect into ‘the dialect which is chosen as national speech’ he made the opposite assertion to the same end, putting standard English on a level with the Dorsetshire language which was usually called a ‘dialect’. And when, in 1700, John Dryden modernized parts of The Canterbury Tales—or, as he put it, ‘translated Chaucer into English’—he advanced his own claim to be writing a civilized English worth the name, quite different from the undeveloped medium that Chaucer had to work in.
