Each one is neither exactly an original nor exactly a translation, and they are all as close to one another as possible. But close is not identical. Where there are different languages there will necessarily be different meanings too.

The European Parliament and its associated organizations jointly form an enormous ‘interpretive community’ whose job is to determine what ‘an ever closer union’, ‘une union sans cesse plus étroite’, and the cognate phrases in the other languages should all mean in terms of the political and legal measures that the European Union can carry out. So the fact that all these treaties are inter-translatable is not enough for them to have the same meaning. They need to be anchored in the same structures of interpretation as well.
