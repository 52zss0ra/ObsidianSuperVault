Treaties + international agreements drawn up by EU must be in diff langs 4 parties
- all as close to one another as possible; each neither original nor translation
- but not identical... Where there are different languages there will necessarily be different meanings too. // [[cultural contexts mean words can't be translated exactly]]


enormous ‘interpretive community’ whose job is to determine what ‘an ever closer union’, ‘une union sans cesse plus étroite’, and the cognate phrases in the other languages should all mean in terms of the political and legal measures that the European Union can carry out. 

So the fact that all these treaties are inter-translatable is not enough for them to have the same meaning. They need to be anchored in the same structures of interpretation as well.
