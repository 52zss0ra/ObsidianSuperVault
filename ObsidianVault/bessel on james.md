(only concerns reparations)

reparations having a stabilising effect on pol system? yes
			- circumscribed the options of Germany
			- bc of threat of foreign intervention
			- so in a climate of blaming it was good that the target was foreign, unifying what was divided


but then again, caused 'fearsome' outcry against Stresemann for 1923 measures, the vitriolic RW response to Young Plan

// also i feel like the stab in the back myth bc Weimar pols were forced to write a blank check, which was understood to be by many a betrayal
