The rise of the Nazis: Sonderweg or spanner in the works? (In Mary Fulbrook's *German History Since 1800*)
[[my bibliography]]


- [[NatSoc thrived not solely because of old aspects but bc fused with modern qualities of 20th c]]
	
	end of section says: these elements coexisted in uneasy tandem, but where their paths crossed, there would be a collision between (Germany's urban industrial economy and society - most modern in europe) and (the traditional 'backward' sections of society which felt increasingly threatened by new classes, institutions and practices)

- [[NSDAP structure and methods]]
	- [[lots of societal cleavages and an NSDAP that pays attention to milieu...]] 

- [[role of depression]]

- [[incompetence of other parties]]


## [[the destruction of democracy (p313-314) Bruning's, Von Papen's, von schleicher's roles]]


## where do we lie on sonderweg vs spanner?

defo not spanner bc managed to organise where many didnt 'singlemindedness + skill' + relied on ToV grievances

equally, not sonderweg because there would have been many moments in much more recent history that would have avoided the lack of faith in democracy (e.g. 1918-19 unmistakable defeat __would have__ crushed stab in the back; early Weimar govts standing up to the treaties more or impl policies to stop hyperinfl sooner __would have__ avoided MC alienation + susceptibility to nazi appeal)

G's main problem was too many internal contradictions, 'too many particularisms and too little ground for consensus'.
	parls + TUs failing to provide solutions for immediate problems led {those who had never believed in it} along with {those disillusioned} to sabotage weimar democracy
...damaged b4 the depression struck. 
		then the q of who will follow is answered by depression giving NSDAP that boost
