2... New Order common (or uncommon) ideas, shared expansionist goals challenged by Wilsonian LoN diplomacy etc.

3... To consider the sig of personal factors in the making + maintaining of transnational relations (Musso + H most visible, prevalent)

4... The construction of the relationship

5... Analysis of the tension between the propagandistic depictions of consensus for the Italo-German alliance and the more complex reality of prevailing and strengthening national stereotypes

## Chapter 1 - The first meeting
at first Hitler's pretty fringe so Musso only clandestinely communicates with him. needs to keep in Weimar Govt's good graces. examples of this include not organising a state visit (st8 not inviting him, but musso yes) and keeps cancelling. Also all the admiring letters H sends to musso
