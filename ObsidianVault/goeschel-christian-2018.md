[[goeschel's aim]]

[[similarities pointed out]]

[[conflicts in relationship]] 

[[mussolini as a blueprint 4 nazism - not bumbling buffoon]]

[[quick outline of trajectory]]

[[importance of performance + representation]]

[[a different kind of diplomacy freed from experts' advice]]

1... Political ramifications of the 'emotive politics', + what techniques used to achieve this. Staging via propaganda

2... New Order common (or uncommon) ideas, shared expansionist goals challenged by Wilsonian LoN diplomacy etc.

3... To consider the sig of personal factors in the making + maintaining of transnational relations (Musso + H most visible, prevalent)

4... The construction of the relationship

5... Analysis of the tension between the propagandistic depictions of consensus for the Italo-German alliance and the more complex reality of prevailing and strengthening national stereotypes

## Chapter 1 - In Mussolini's Shadow
at first Hitler's pretty fringe so Musso only clandestinely communicates with him. needs to keep in Weimar Govt's good graces. examples of this include not organising a state visit (*__guest of the fascist party yes__*) and keeps cancelling. Also all the admiring letters H sends to musso

To gain legitimacy, Hitler draws on the Fascist name. Just shows which is more prevalent really. he also sacrifices south tyrol (polemic, would lose him supporters on the right) to keep good relation w Italy
	'it was not Fascist ideology as such but the Fascist method of seizing and consolidating power that attracted Hitler.'

Also how Hitler fell for propaganda bc Musso's reign was far from totalitarian, but yeah march on rome served as foundational myth for beer hall putsch

[[power dynamics]] after sept 1930 reichstag elections (nazi success) increased from 12 to 107 seats, now 2nd biggest party, musso began to increase support 4 them

what their relationship meant 4 politics: h, against some nazi ops, stressed *legality*, which Renzetti (italian advisor) suggested as a means of taking power as italians had done: don't join conservative coalition as junior partner


## Chapter 2 - First Date


## Conclusion
good italian as opposed to evil german much less genocidal [[less obvious or public victims of italian fascism]] [[some say the reason for this 'italini brave gente', Bosworth rebuts with crimes and violence of italians shown]] ideas pushed post-war to distance italy from the axis

[[musso + h's relationship wasnt pure propaganda though]]
[[display of friendship succeeded in obscuring the rivalry, tensions]]
[[relationship was overshadowed by their pretensions to world domination and by petty personal jealousies]]
