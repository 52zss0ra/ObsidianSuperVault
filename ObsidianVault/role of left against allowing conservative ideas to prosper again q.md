tbh it was a revolution from above, the left weren't realising the perfect utopian dream
	- doing too much (p129, 130) wouldn't have been the best idea
		"the pressing economic problems of late 1918 and early 1919 dictated rejection of ambitious structural plans and acceptance of a policy of 'muddling' through"
	- this was just dumped on their lap, try what they can


thus "perhaps less the consequence of the triumph of the left than of a colossal failure of elite politics"
	- also, radical leftism would not have been supported by pop, see RW uprisings and murders of leftists *(p131-132)*
	// - p132 big claim about G too divided similar to [[stephenson-jill-1997]] concluding point in 'where do we lie on sonderweg vs spanner?' (properly link this in future)
