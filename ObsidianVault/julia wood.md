it did start out as a question I asked myself because initially I thought of doing homosexuality under the soviets (too overwhelming to sort through), but in what I had started reading was Karlinsky making the bold claim that the Silver Age of literature was the best thing ever for queer Russians which then got quashed by Soviet oppression! I just didn't buy it and thought this would be interesting instead

limitations:
	not narrow enough of a focus I think. There was a lot more depth to the topic, esp medicine that I didn't manage to delve into. I'd even started with 3 areas (+literature) but cut because I wasn't delving into it satisfactorily, but yk the things we know now...
