*(p258-261)* [[silly decision making based on authoritarian aims]]


*(p263-265)* [[elites' lack of support and NSDAP's rolling in it]]


*(p268-269)* [[anti-fascism paralysed]]


Reasons outlined 4 WR's end:
1. [[economic and social crises]]
2. [[loss of legitimacy]]
3. [[the elites' insistence on destroying democracy]]
4. [[handing power to Hitler]]

*(p271)* [[not sonderweg! (not following outdated ideals!) modernisation!]] (The nazis' bravado + new methods of modernisation is what meant democracy finally collapsed into the extreme authoritarian regime that ensued)


- the government elites bear 2 burdens of responsibility: 
			1. that they repudiated democracy [[the elites' insistence on destroying democracy]]
			2. that they threw in their lot with hitler when the authoritarian road led to a dead end. [[handing power to Hitler]]
// this I think links nicely with what [[holtfrerich-carl-ludwig-1990]] has to say on room for manoeuvre
