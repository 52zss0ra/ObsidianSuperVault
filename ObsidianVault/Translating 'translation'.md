every language has its own terms which relate to ‘translation’ but never completely equate to it. There is no exact translation of ‘translation’.

e.g.
In Igbo, there are two words that seem close to ‘translation’, but they have distinctive connotations:
	Tapia comes from the roots ta, ‘tell, narrate’, and pia, ‘destruction, break [it] up’ with the overall sense of ‘deconstruct it and tell it (in a different form)’. Kowa has a similar meaning, deriving from ko, ‘narrate, talk about’ and wa, ‘break in pieces’. In Igbo translation is an activity that stresses the viability of the communication as narration, allowing for decomposition and a change in form rather than one-to-one reconstruction.
(Maria Tymoczko, Enlarging Translation, Empowering Translators)


There are simple and complex reasons why there is no exact translation of ‘translation’. The simple reason is that there is no exact translation of any word; different languages can never be brought into point-for-point alignment. 
***** Because the activities we can call ‘translation’ are so varied, the word ‘translation’ keeps having to stretch or shrink to fit them. It keeps on being ‘translated’, in the Bottom-like sense of shifting shape and meaning.
