1. - the beginning of the republic wasn't marked by a politically unifying event (in the fashion of the American declaration of independence, or Sedan day after creation of G empire)
    -rather, there were competing symbolic proclamations by Spartacist Karl Liebknecht and SPD minister Scheidemann
		    The WR 'did not come into being as the result of an heroic act, or of an act which national mythology could represent as heroic' *(p6)*
    -'the fact that the Republic had **no legitimising founding ritual implies a lack of legitimacy** in general; it suggests that there was a **lack of active commitment to the new order**' *(p6)* 


<u>bridge: 'when... economic activity and social conditions reached the point of crisis, there were few reserves of public legitimacy on which the republic could draw'</u> *(p6)*


2. - On top of this econ problems. [[just a list of the econ1social problems in WR peukert illustrates]]
			'the unspectacular new arrangements might have survived if, or as long as, acceptable  living conditions had prevailed' *(p6)* //fair-weather
	-industrial expansion stagnated after 1914 *(p12)* 
	-particularly RW and LW economists between 1929-33 argued that capitalism had reached saturation point or entered its final phase of collapse
	
	-which ofc affected how German people saw their lives, future hopes + expectations. (super bleak) and would recall the 'good old monarchist days' *(p13)*
			'as if its problems of political legitimacy were not enough, the WR was also unable to win pop confidence on the economic front'
