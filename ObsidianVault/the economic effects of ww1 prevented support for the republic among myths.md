- lower standards of living couldn't help but be reflected after war *(e.g. on p123)*

- to combat the price of having gone to war, the govt needed to have introduced the necessary policies to keep democracy going, but needed more popular support for them to do this so couldn't (led to hyperinfl + less faith in them from there) [[elites' lack of support and NSDAP's rolling in it]]

- additionally, among myths germans failed to recognise how much poorer their country had become, expecting it to hit the perceived greatness of 1913 levels 'peacetime prices'. 
	Versailles blamed for impoverishing Germany, where having participated in the war also just did

- the anti-Versailles consensus was essentially negative among pop so this undermined the policies which took account of these realities

"As long as blame for the war... was not placed squarely on the representatives of the old political system, it was impossible for those identifying with Weimar democracy to deal completely honestly with the problems facing them and maintain the popular support necessary for successful democratic politics." // as linked above,,, bessel does just attribute it to earlier though
