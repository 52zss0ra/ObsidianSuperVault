I think it's misread as rude but it's observing how drug addicts use it to relieve them from the torment of their daily lives and bear it but doesn't truly offer them freedom within the capitalist system. I think it's compassionate in a way --> grandma praying for unattainable things and indulging in prayer after horrible things happen instead of holding anyone real accountable or making changes to life
