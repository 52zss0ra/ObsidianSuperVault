- lots of parties would only get support from one specific demographic (SPD with industrial workers, DNVP with east elbian landowning class)
	- resulting in weak 'marriage of convenience' coalitions ... couldn't survive after [[role of depression]]


- the political identity of some parties is lost, e.g. traditional nationalists but now not monarchists


- fringe interest groups drew people out of their est milieu to 'apolitical' but their political groups, this is where NSDAP thrived because managed to gain support across societal cleavages *(p306)*
		like support for the political centre (DDP, DVP) haemorrhaged *(p302)*
		and from proletarian workers 3.5 mil in july 32 *(p308)*
		
		// imo you can see how support for catholic centre party stayed potent because of how much of people's identity catholicism was in a land where the ruling elites looked down on it and wanted protestantism
		// okay you can back this up on p310
