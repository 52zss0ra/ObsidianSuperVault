starts off by recognising how unlikely success would be for Weimar due to 3 things: post-war effects, hyperinflation, then depression. bc agrees to a reasonable extent that 'economics is destiny' bc runs tightly together with politics *(p129-130)*
	"the numbers of Germans adversely affected by inflation and rationalisation, let alone depression, were legion and their grievances found a ready voice on the right and the left"
	"social resentments, never far below the surface in Weimar, became acute" *(p139)*
	[[james-harold-1990]]

// don't forget that the war is where inflation started *(p131)*

- confidence in Weimar by 1923 had collapsed because of poor leadership, chancellor and president of the Reichsbank *(p141)*
- needed emergency powers to deal with so many political threats from everywhere and separatist movements... sad sign of the st8 of the republic *(p141-142)*
- "the paradox of reparations was that they imposed demeaning obligations on the German state while undermining the legitimacy and stability required by the state to fulfil them" *(p144)*
		reparations is what all the opposition would latch on to as well
- "weimar would never fully regain the trust of MC that had lost so much in the inflation" //savings *(p145)*
- also lost WC support for all that decline in wages, loss of 8-hour work day during stabilisation (inflation itself not being bad enough already)
- farmers blamed 'the system' when the depression came


## Stresemann and 1923 onwards
measures:
	- new currency --> halted inflation
	- slashing public payroll by nearly 1/4, and cutting subsidies/welfare
	- worsened conditions for workers to pre-war ones, yielded to big industrialists. giving more power to them and workers less stable (firing/ignoring labour representation), so ig WR tries to gain their confidence and favour
	- ended passive resistance in the Ruhr, which is what industrialists wanted
	- Dawes Plan eased payments, negotiated Young Plan 


## golden years...
--> all this consumerism that followed *(examples from p146-149)* Weitz attributes to people believing that "what had value could, in a flash depreciate to nothing" so thought better to spend than to save
--> rationalisation made workers' lives more difficult. layoffs + unemployment. young people poor job prospects. white and blue collar sacked when old
--> "the 'golden years' certainly did not apply to Weimar's agrarian sector" *(p160)*
###### "for the Right... the Great Depression... provided a golden opportunity. Now it could again contemplate seriously the overthrow of the republic" *(p161)*

## DEPRESSION + CHOICES
	- on why bruning pursued deflation: "Virtually everyone had the experience of 1923 in mind: the dangers of inflation, in their view, far outweighed the deflationary policies pursued by the Reich." *(p163)*


## could it have been different? *(p167-168)*
blockages:
	- ww1's legacy + reparations
	- lack of 'creative and imaginative' economic leadership
actually:
	- policy choices resulted in â†‘ influence of (major industrial and financial interests) e.g. after the 1918-19 revolutionary movement where the SPD gave in to big business. WEITZ thinks if they'd had more creative leadership they could have reigned in big business (anti-democratic). Further, in the Depression the deflationary policies (which businesses favoured) were also pursued bc leadership gives into that
			// okay so bc they had sm influence they rolled back workers' rights etc fostering discontent with the system
			// how would the WR be supposed to stay in power not pandering to big business tho
