starts off by recognising how unlikely success would be for Weimar due to 3 things: post-war effects, hyperinflation, then depression. bc agrees to a reasonable extent that 'economics is destiny' bc runs tightly together with politics *(p129-130)*
	"the numbers of Germans adversely affected by inflation and rationalisation, let alone depression, were legion and their grievances found a ready voice on the right and the left"
	"social resentments, never far below the surface in Weimar, became acute" *(p139)*
	[[james-harold-1990]]

// don't forget that the war is where inflation started *(p131)*

- confidence in Weimar by 1923 had collapsed because of poor leadership, chancellor and president of the Reichsbank *(p141)*
- needed emergency powers to deal with so many political threats from everywhere and separatist movements... sad sign of the st8 of the republic *(p141-142)*
- "the paradox of reparations was that they imposed demeaning obligations on the German state while undermining the legitimacy and stability required by the state to fulfil them" *(p144)*
		reparations is what all the opposition would latch on to as well
- "weimar would never fully regain the trust of MC that had lost so much in the inflation" //savings *(p145)*
- also lost WC support for all that decline in wages, loss of 8-hour work day during stabilisation (inflation itself not being bad enough already)
- farmers blamed 'the system' when the depression came


## Stresemann and 1923 onwards
measures:
	- new currency --> halted inflation
	- slashing public payroll by nearly 1/4, and cutting subsidies/welfare
	- worsened conditions for workers to pre-war ones, yielded to big industrialists. giving more power to them and workers less stable (firing/ignoring labour representation), so ig WR tries to gain their confidence and favour
	- ended passive resistance in the Ruhr, which is what industrialists wanted
	- Dawes Plan eased payments, negotiated Young Plan
