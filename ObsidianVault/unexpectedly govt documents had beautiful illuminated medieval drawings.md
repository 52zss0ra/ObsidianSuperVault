incredible artistic feat of medieval world guilding, usually found in rich womens' book of hours (religious), inspiring devotion

used in documents to represent importance + status (not only scribe paid but artist commissioned too)
		land petition for lobbying purposes + space left blank 4 drawing but then ran out of money

many achieved via unconventional means too bc to keep wheels of the st8 turning didnt allow 4 such intricacies
		legal evidence 4 court never never claimed again also "archival accidents" where personal papers joined st8 business. monastic docs... these orgs conducted business like the monarchs
