for books read b4 obsidian so w/o notes on but still thematically relevant use #writeuponthis

for notes not made atomic yet use #atomthis

for atomic notes that you think need to be linked use #linkthis

for a note on a theme containing grouped links to sort the structure use #collectionNote .This may be used when a certain topic's notes become unnavegable and too large and overwhelming to find an entrance point/look through
