- a commodity; what a worker sells to an employer
- one's capacity to work, quantitively measured by time
- the worker is paid a wage in exchange for providing labour power


The goal of the employer in consuming the labour power they have purchased is the commodity emerging at the end of the process of production, a commodity whose value exceeds the combined value of (1) the used up tools, equipment and raw materials, plus (2) the value of the wage paid for the purchased labour power. 
																	That excess = surplus value.
