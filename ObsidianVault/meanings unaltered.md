Jacques Derrida wrote a celebrated essay entitled ‘Des tours de Babel’, pointing out that proper nouns like ‘Babel’ belong equally to different languages, including French and English, and arguing that it was therefore impossible to establish a complete distinction between them. He might just as well have focused on all sorts of words that are shared between what we think of as different languages, often with minor shifts of spelling and pronunciation.

Of course the spelling and pronunciation have some slight differences, but how much of a barrier are they? Everyone has their own accent and vocal timbre, and speakers from different regions of England may sound as strange to one another as to someone from France. As for spelling, rules have only become established in Europe over the last 300 years or so, under the pressure of printing and formal modes of written communication like school essays and government reports. People’s actual spelling (when uncorrected by computer) varies widely and we might perfectly well come across ‘paragraphe’, ‘prononciation’, ‘langage’, and ‘essai’ in a piece of English writing alongside ‘distinction’ and ‘impossible’. The variant spellings may be incorrect according to the currently accepted rulebooks; but that needn’t stop them being used and understood by English speakers.
