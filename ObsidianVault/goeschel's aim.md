"exploration of their friendship, its representation and its overall political significance"
																					--> "At a time when the interpretation of the Second World war is sometimes skewed towards eastern Europe's 'bloodlands' - an interpretation that potentially erases crucial differences between Stalin's and Hitler's regimes - this book should serve as a reminder that, as a fatal result of the Italo-German entanglement, italy became a theatre of war in 1943, and experienced what some have called a civil war."

"through my focus on the representation of their relationship I reconsider the power - reconstructed, imagined and real - of Mussolini and Hitler to shape and run foreign policy."

1) "I contend that the history of the alliance between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany was much more complex than... the alliance [being] more or less motivated by a shared ideology and successful cooperation."

2) exploring the bond between the two leaders via the wider context of more unconventional diplomacy
				"The history of the relationship between Mussolini and Hitler /(the political relationship of the two principal fascist statesmen in its wider context)/ helps to reveal the mass of inner contradictions that existed within fascism."
				
				Rather than pursuing a theoretical project along the lines of the theories of scholars such as Roger Griffin and Roger Eatwell concerning the ‘fascist minimum’ or a ‘consensus in fascist studies’, which would risk distorting the complexities, ambiguities and tensions within the archetypal fascist bond between Mussolini and Hitler

				instead Naoko Shimazu and Johannes Paulmann inspired by, whose work has focused on the rituals, ceremonies, emotions, gestures and other socio-cultural aspects of diplomacy that help to effect political outcomes, I approach the Mussolini–Hitler relationship through the dialectics of 
	national interests, emotions and ideology. Itineraries, correspondence and seemingly trivial aspects of politics, such as dress codes, salutations and meeting venues, matter for our understanding of the Mussolini–Hitler relationship. In this way, the broader significance of this bond will become clear.
